# Contributing

Anyone can submit a pull request, to do so follow these steps:

* Fork, then clone the repo:

  `git clone git@github.com:your-username/promise-cr.git`

* Make sure the tests pass:

  `crystal spec`

* Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

  `crystal spec`

* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

  At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on pull requests
  within three business days (and, typically, one business day). I may suggest
  some changes or improvements or alternatives.

#### Things that will increase the chance of your pull request being accepted:

* Write tests.
* Format your code using `crystal tool format`.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
